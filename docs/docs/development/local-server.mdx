# Quirrel Instance

It is crucial to understand how to run a Quirrel local development instance. Here's a step-by-step guide:

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure that you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v14 or above)
- Your preferred package manager - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

## Steps to Run Quirrel in Local Development Instance

1.  **Install Quirrel as a Project Dependency**

   You need to add Quirrel to your project dependencies. Depending on the package manager you are using, the command would be one of the following:

   <Tabs>

   <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

   ```bash
   pnpm install quirrel
   ```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

   ```bash
   yarn add quirrel
   ```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

   ```bash
   npm install quirrel
   ```

   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2.  **Running Quirrel Locally**

   There are two ways to run Quirrel on your local development instance:

   - You can append Quirrel to your existing dev command in your `package.json` file. Here is an example:

   <Tabs>

   <TabItem value="unix" label="Unix">

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "next dev & quirrel"
    }
    ```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="windows" label="windows">

   If you are developing on a windows machine you can use concurrently to achieve this.

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "concurrently 'next dev' 'quirrel'"
    }
    ```

   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   - If you have installed Quirrel globally, you can run the Quirrel CLI command directly in your terminal:

   ```bash
   quirrel
   ```

Please note that running Quirrel locally might require you to have a local instance of Redis, depending upon your configuration.
